# Python Programming Basics

This repository showcases my understanding of Python fundamentals.
It contains small, focused programs that demonstrate core concepts
such as conditional statements, loops, and number-based logic.

The purpose of this repository is to document what I have studied
and practiced while learning Python and to serve as proof of my
foundational programming skills.

## Topics Covered

### Conditional Statements
- Odd and Even number check
- Prime number check (count method)
- Voting eligibility
- Largest among three numbers
- Nested if–else decision making (age categories)

### Looping Statements
- Counting numbers from 1 to 20
- Multiplication table of a number
- Factorial of a number

### Number-Based Logic Programs
- Palindrome number
- Armstrong number
- Sum of digits of a number
- Sum of unique digits of a number

## Notes
These programs focus on clarity, correctness, and logical thinking.
They are intentionally simple and are meant to demonstrate strong
foundational understanding rather than advanced frameworks or libraries.
